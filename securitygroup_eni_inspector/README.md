# Security Group ENI Inspector

<br>

## Description

This script is designed to run on an AWS Lambda Function. The Lambda Function expects an event that contains Security Group IDs, and conforms to the following structure:

```
{
  "sg1": "sg-0f813c42c4c55643b",
  "sg2": "sg-0a84a401c5bf6ef9d",
  "sg3": "sg-0e4890977444a19e3"
}
```

When the Lambda Function is invoked, it will retrieve information about the ENI associations for each Security Group ID. It also checks whether the provided Security Groups are referenced by any other Security Group in the specified AWS region.

<br>

## Key Features
- Retrieves the ENI associations for the specified Security Group.
- Identifies which Security Groups in the specified AWS region reference the target Security Groups.

<br>

## Lambda Function Requirements

| Runtime | Memory | Timeout | Environment Variables |
| ------- | ------ | ------- | --------------------- |
| Python 3.10 | 1024 MB | 15 minutes (900 seconds) | Key: region_name <br> Value: <aws_region> <br><br> Example: `eu-west-1` |

<br>

## Lambda Execution Role

The Lambda Execution Role must contain the `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` policy, as well as permissions to call the following APIs:

- `ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces`
- `ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups`

<br>

## Usage
### Event Structure

The Lambda Function expects an event that contains Security Group IDs. The event must be formatted as a dictionary with the Security Group IDs as values as follows:

```
{
  "sg1": "sg-0f813c42c4c55643b",
  "sg2": "sg-0a84a401c5bf6ef9d",
  "sg3": "sg-0e4890977444a19e3"
}
```

## Script Functions

| Function Name | Details | Args | Returns | Raises | Logs |
| ------------- | ------- | ---- | ------- | ------ | ---- |
| `sg_to_eni_mapper` | Retrieve and log information about ENI (Elastic Network Interfaces) associations for a specified Security Group. <br><br> *This function performs the following operations:* <br><br> 1. Retrieves and logs the name of the Security Group. <br><br> 2. Retrieves and logs the ENIs associated to the Security Group. <br><br> 3. Returns a dictionary that includes a list of ENI IDs associated with the specified Security Group, and the Security Group ID itself. | `securitygroup_id (str)` <br><br> The ID of the Security Group for which to retrieve ENI associations and Security Group references. | `dict` - A dictionary containing: <br><br> `eni_ids (list(str))` - A list of ENIs associated with the specified Security Group. <br><br> `securitygroup_id (str)` - The ID of the successfully processed Security Group. <br><br> *Sample output:* <pre>{<br>    'eni_ids': eni_ids,<br>    'securitygroup_id': securitygroup_id<br>}</pre> | Exception: Re-raises any exceptions encountered while retrieving the Security Group name or ENI associations. Exceptions are logged with error details. <br><br> **NOTE:** <br> Any exceptions encountered will be propagated to the calling function *(i.e. main())* where they will be handled. | `[INFO]` - Logs details about the Security Group and its associated ENIs. <br><br> `[ERROR]` - Logs any errors encountered while retrieving the Security Group details or ENI associations. |
| check_sg_references | Check which Security Groups in the region are referencing the specified Security Groups in `event_sgs`. <br><br> *This function performs the following operations:* <br><br> 1. Retrieves all the Security Groups in the specified AWS region. <br><br> 2. Checks which of these Security Groups reference the Security Groups specified in `event_sgs` in the inbound or outbound rules. <br><br> 3. Logs and returns these references. | `event_sgs (list(str))` - A list containing the target Security Group IDs. | `referencing_sgs (list(dict))` - A list of dictionaries, with each dictionary containing: <br><br> Target Security Group ID - The ID of the Security Group in `event_sgs`. <br><br> Reference Security Group: The ID of the Security Group that references the target Security Group in either the inbound or outbound rules. <br><br> *Sample output:* <pre>[<br>{"Target Security Group ID:": target_sg,<br>    "Referenced by this Security Group:": sg_id}, <br> ...]</pre> | Exception: Re-raises any exceptions encountered while retrieving all the Security Groups in the specified region. Exceptions are logged with error details. <br><br> **NOTE:** <br> Any exceptions encountered will be propagated to the calling function *(i.e. main())*. | `[INFO]` - Logs details about the Security Group references. <br><br> `ERROR` - Logs any errors encountered while retrieving the Security Groups in the region. |
| `main` | Main function to process the event and orchestrate the necessary operations. <br><br> *This function performs the following operations:* <br><br> 1. Iterates over the Security Group IDs provided in the event. <br><br> 2. Calls `sg_to_eni_mapper` for each Security Group ID to retrieve the ENI associations. <br><br> 3. Collects the Security Group IDs for which the ENI associations were successfully retrieved. <br><br> 4. Calls `check_sg_references` to determine which Security Groups in the specified AWS region reference the collected Security Groups, stored in `target_sgs`. <br><br> 5. Logs information about the target Security Groups. | `event (dict)` | `None` | `None` | `[INFO]` - Logs details about the target *(collected)* Security Groups. |
| `lambda_handler` | The AWS Lambda Function handler is executed when the Lambda Function is invoked. This function calls `main()` and returns **Success** or **Error** responses. | `event (dict)` - An event containing Security Group IDs. <br><br> `context(LambdaContext)` - The context object provided by the AWS Lambda service *(not used in this script)*. | `dict` - A dictionary containing: <br><br> `statusCode (int)` - HTTP status code indicating the result of the code execution. A `200` status code indicates that the code executed successfully. A `500` status code indicates that the code failed. <br><br> *Sample output:* <pre>return {<br>    'statusCode': 200,<br>    'body': json.dumps('Code executed successfully!')<br>}</pre> | `None` | `[INFO]` - Logs whether the event was processed successfully, or if no Security Groups were specified. <br><br> `[ERROR]` - Logs any errors encountered during the execution. |

<br>

## Setup

1. Navigate to the AWS CloudShell console.
2. Upload `app.py` and `deploy_securitygroup_eni_inspector.sh`:
   - Click on `Actions` ----> `Upload file`.
   - Browse to the location on your pc where the files are stored.
3. Once the files have been uploaded, add execute permissions to `deploy_securitygroup_eni_inspector.sh`:
   `chmod +x deploy_securitygroup_eni_inspector.sh`
4. Run the script to deploy the Lambda Function:
   `./ deploy_securitygroup_eni_inspector`
